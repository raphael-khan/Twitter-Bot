# Twitter_Bot

Created a REST API to interact with a userâ€™s twitter account, make API calls and parse the response to trigger automated bots.

  * The generous bot is set up to either follow back a specfic friend request or automactially
    follow back any friend request received on the account.
    
  * The narcissistic bot is set up to iterate through posts on Twitter ( past 30 days ) using a search string parameter. 
    The seach parameter can include a title or a user name. The searched post can then be set up to either liked automatically or retweeted. 
    
    
 
/// The "narcisstic" twitter bot automated to searching Twiiter with a given search string paramter "python' search string and favoriting / liking them. In this case the bot was set up to like the 5 latest posts containing the string "python"
